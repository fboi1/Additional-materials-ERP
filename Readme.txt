# Stock Price Movement Prediction Using MultiRocket + HYDRA

This repository contains all code used for my MSc dissertation project, which explores directional stock price prediction using time series classification (TSC) techniques,  specifically the MultiRocket + HYDRA models, benchmarked against traditional machine learning models like SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest.

# Project Goal

To evaluate whether advanced TSC models like MultiRocket and HYDRA can outperform traditional ML models in predicting short-term stock price movements, using directional classification (up/down) and backtested via a Donchian breakout trading strategy.
